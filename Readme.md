# Hackathon for Ericsson Weather Challenge 

## Available

- Local, 'micro data' for local weather

## Challenge

- Provide municipalities with short term (half an hour) forecasts of local weather

## Values to Deliver
- To improve waterworks and planning
- To automatically turn on and off pumps
- To give give citizens access to the same kind of forecasts for their personal use cases

## Hypothesis
- By combining Ericsson's data with 'user data', parsing it to an open forecasting model and feeding the whole cha-bang into TensorFLow, we can get the local, short term forecasts that will deliver the value.

## Examples of User Data

### Automated
- Geo location
- Device signal profile

### User Genereated
- Pictures of the sky
- Waze-like confirmation of weather conditions (opt-in notifications ask you to confirm if it's raining or not

## Open Forecasting Model
- IIFS

## Machine Learning Platform
- TensorFlow
